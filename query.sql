a. for audio CDs released more than one year ago the discount is 20%
b. for vinyl records released more than one year ago the discount is 15%
c. for MP3 downloads released more than two years ago the discount is 10%
Note that the signature of the discountPrice method is included in the original OMDB script for
both disk_type and mp3_type subtypes.

create or replace type body disk_type as
overriding member function discountPrice return number is discountPrice number;
begin
if ((sysdate() - albumReleaseDate)/365>1 and mediaType='Audio CD') then
discountPrice := albumPrice - (albumPrice/5) ;
end if;
if ((sysdate() - albumReleaseDate)/365>1 and mediaType='Vinyl') then
discountPrice := albumPrice - (albumPrice*3)/20 ;
end if;
return discountPrice;
end;
end;

select a.albumPrice, a.discountPrice(),treat(value(a) as disk_type).mediaType
